# MATSim-ems Independent Study (AY2019-2)
## Introduction
This is the repo containing supporting docs for the MATSim Model of Emergency Response Network of New Windsor, NY. The "Data" folder contains network files for varying scenarios, as well as supporting docs for demand generation. The "Code" folder contains supporting code for initial demand generation. The "Outputs" folder contain sample output files of MATSim, which you can use to compare results.
## Usage
Download project, then put project in whichever folder contains the **MATSimxxx.jar** file. Double-click **scripts.bat** for our custom script to run and execute your defined scenario!
### Notes
* Make sure to disable McAfee so that MATSim can run! If not the anti-virus will simply refuse to let MATSim run!
* MATSim will exit with an error if an **output** folder is already present. Delete the folder or rename it to prevent this from happening!
